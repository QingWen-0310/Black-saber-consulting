## Introduction 
#what the report will cover
#setting scope and expectations
As it is requested by the Black Saber Consulting Company due to the worry of potential biases existed within their employee's benefits and hiring process, 
the following report will be analyzing the data given by Black Saber Consulting Company regarding their company potential biases within hiring and remuneration processes. The report includes an abstract, data exploration, data analysis, model building, executive summary, result and conclusions. The study is built upon five data sets from Black Saber Consulting Company of different phases: three hiring phases, the final hires, and the current employee information. The report is done through the software R-studio and JupyterHub. In the data explore section, the data shall be examined at first to check for correlations and potential variables to be used for data analysis and model building section. The statisticians choose the best fitted model and explain in the model building section. Finally the result section includes graphs and plots of the final evidence to answer the raised research question, which will be answered in the conclusion section. The report is confidential and will solely be used for the Black Saber Consulting Company only.


### Research questions

- Is gender a significant determinant of being a successful applicant in each hiring phase?

- Does gender affect how many promotions an employee during its employment?

- Is the amount of salary determined based only on the talents and performance of the employees?


### Data Manipulation & Exploratory plots/summary tables

#### Variables

- *cover_letter*: categorical, whether the applicant submitted a cover letter
- *cv*: categorical, whether the applicant submitted a CV
- *gpa*: numerical, applicant's GPA at school on scale of 4.0
- *gender*, categorical, applicant's gender, including man, woman and prefer not to say
- *extracurriculars*: number of extracurricular activities the applicant have
- *work_experience*: number of work experiences the applicant have

```{r}
# add indicator variables of whether the applicant passed phase-I
success <- hire_phase2$applicant_id
hire_phase1 <- hire_phase1 %>% 
  mutate(pass = ifelse(applicant_id %in% success, 1, 0))

# add indicator variables of whether the applicant passed phase-II
success_2 <- hire_phase3$applicant_id
hire_phase2 <- hire_phase2 %>% 
  mutate(pass = ifelse(applicant_id %in% success_2, 1, 0))

# add indicator variable of whether the applicant passed phase-III
success_3 <- hire_final$applicant_id
hire_phase3 <- hire_phase3 %>% 
  mutate(pass_final = ifelse(applicant_id %in% success_3, 1, 0))

### Data manipulation?? Not sure

By looking at the data for each phase, we can figure out which applicants successfully passed the previous phase by looking at the common *id*s between two phases. For instance, applicants included in the phase II data set are the ones who passed phase I. Following this logic, we create a new variable in each phase that takes value of 1 if the candidate passed this phase, and 0 otherwise. 

To investigate the question, we drew out some exploratory plots. We found that in the phase I selection, all the candidates who did not submit a CV or a cover letter did not pass phase I, as *Figure 1* and *Figure 2* shows. Hence, if a candidate did not submit these two files, then other potential determinants for success like *GPA* and *work experience* become irrelevant in determining whether the candidate passes the current phase. Therefore, we decide to filter out the observations that do not have a CV/cover letter present in phase I, which reduces out sample size from 613 observations to 355 observations. Even though there is a large reduction in the sample size, we think the manipulation is necessary as we can investigate how other factors play a role in the selection process. 

### Result?? Not Sure

After creating the indicator variable, we then looked at the proportion of different gender passing each phase. Referring to *Table 1*, in phase I, 48.3% male, 50.7% female, and 1% prefer not to say passed this phase. There seems to be an even split between males and females who successfully passed the phase. Moving on to phase II, the split between males and females become a bit uneven, as among all those passed the phase, 68.2% are males while 31.8% are females, with 0% of prefer not to say. Lastly, in phase III, the ratio of males to females who passed this phase becomes 4:1. This preliminary observation leads us to think whether the selection algorithm is based solely on candidates' skills, or does gender affects the probability of a candidate being selected as successful candidate? If gender does play a role, then how big is the impact?

### Method

```{r}
# filter out observations without cv or cover letter
hire_phase1_filtered <- hire_phase1 %>%
  filter(cv == 1) %>%
  filter(cover_letter == 1)
```

Table 2: Proportion of candidates passing Phase-I by gender with filtered observations

|                   | Does not pass | Pass |
|-------------------|---------------|------|
| Man               | 0.47          | 0.48 |
| Prefer not to say | 0.02          | 0.01 |
| Woman             | 0.51          | 0.51 |

After filtering out the observations that do not submit a CV or a cover letter, we again make a summary table that contains the proportion of candidates passing Phase-I of the hiring process by gender. From *Table 2*, we see that among those candidates who successfully passed Phase-I, 48% of them are male and 51% of them are female, with the rest 1% having a gender of "prefer not to say". Hence, from the table summary, it seems that the Phase-I hiring is pretty fair across genders. 

```{r}
h1f_male <- hire_phase1_filtered %>% 
  filter(gender == "Man")
h1f_female <- hire_phase1_filtered %>% 
  filter(gender == "Woman")
h1f_pns <- hire_phase1_filtered %>% 
  filter(gender == "Prefer not to say")
# summary(h1f_female)
# summary(h1f_male)
# summary(h1f_pns)

gen <- c("Man", "Woman", "Prefer not to say")
num <- c(171, 180, 4)
gpa_median <- c(3.00, 3.00, 2.40)
extra_median <- c(1.00, 1.00, 1.00)
work_median <- c(1.00, 1.00, 1.00)

sum_filtered_table <- data_frame(gen, num, gpa_median, extra_median, work_median)
colnames(sum_filtered_table) <- c("Gender", "Number", "GPA", "Extracurricular", "Work experience")
kable(sum_filtered_table, caption = "Median statistics by gender")
```

*Table 3* displays the median statistics for *GPA*, number of *Extracurricular*, and the number of *Work experience* the candidates have by gender. There is a relatively even split between the number of *male* and *female* candidates, while *prefer not to say* only has 4 candidates. Despite this, the median values for each of the variables seem to be pretty consistent across different genders. The only discrepancy appears to be *prefer not to say* having a lower *GPA* than the other two genders, potentially due to the small number of observations. 


```{r}
# build model
hire2_mod <- glm(pass~technical_skills + writing_skills + leadership_presence + speaking_skills, family = binomial(), data = hire_phase2)

hire2_ci <- confint(hire2_mod)

# table for reporting
ests_h2 <- format(round(exp(summary(hire2_mod)$coef)[, 1], 2), nsmall = 2)
cis_h2 <- round(exp(hire2_ci), 2)
cis_h2 <- str_c("(", trimws(cis_h2[, 1]), ", ", cis_h2[, 2], ")")
pval_h2 <- round(summary(hire2_mod)$coefficients[, 4], 4)
hire2_rownames <- c("Baseline odds", "Technical skills", "Writing skills", "Leadership_presence", "Speaking_skills")

hire2_colnames <- c("Estimates", "95% CI", "P-value")

hire2_mod_table <- cbind(ests_h2, cis_h2, pval_h2)
rownames(hire2_mod_table) <- hire2_rownames
colnames(hire2_mod_table) <- hire2_colnames
knitr::kable(hire2_mod_table, align = c("r", "r"), caption = "Coefficient estimates for the logistic model built for hiring phase-II")
```

```{r}
# hire2_mod_wg <- glm(pass~gender + technical_skills + writing_skills + leadership_presence + speaking_skills, family = binomial(), data = hire_phase2)
# 
# lmtest::lrtest(hire2_mod, hire2_mod_wg)
```

With phase-II data, the model can be written out as follows: $$log(\frac{\mu_2}{1-\mu_2}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 *\text{Technical skills} + \beta_2 *\text{Writing skills} + \beta_3 * \text{Leadership presence} + \beta_4 * \text{Speaking skills}$$. 

$\mu$: the probability of a candidate passing phase-II
$\beta_i$: coefficient for each variable

According to the model, we include each candidate's scores on *technical skills*, *writing skills*, *leadership presence* and *speaking skills* as our predictors. From the results, we see that the effect of all four predictors are significantly positive, with the odds ratio for *technical skills*, *writing skills*, *leadership presence*, and *speaking skills* being 1.08, 1.09, 2.53, and 2.01. The p-values for the 4 predictors are all significant. Taking the odds ratio of *technical skills* as an example, it means that with a 1 unit increase in *technical skills*, the odds of being a successful candidate in phase-II is 1.08 times higher. 

To investigate whether gender plays a significant role in the phase-II selection, we include *gender* as our predictor in addition to the original four. Then, by performing a Likelihood ratio test, we found that the p-value is around 0.41, suggesting that we lean more towards the simpler model that does not include *gender* as one of its predictors. 


```{r, fig.cap="Histogram of the total scores vs. whether the candidate with the score passed phase-III"}
hire_2_3 <- hire_phase3 %>% 
  mutate(total = interviewer_rating_1 + interviewer_rating_2)%>% 
  mutate(`Pass` = as.factor(ifelse(pass_final == 1, "Yes", "No"))) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total)) %>% 
  left_join(hire_phase2, by = "applicant_id") %>% 
  select(applicant_id, gender, total, `Pass`)

hire_2_3 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total, fill = `Pass`)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#fa8154", "#51c6b9")) +
  labs(x = "Total score") + 
  facet_wrap(~gender)
```


```{r}
hire2_temp <- hire_phase2 %>% 
  filter(applicant_id == 1600 | applicant_id == 3560) %>% 
  select(applicant_id, gender, technical_skills, writing_skills, leadership_presence, speaking_skills)
colnames(hire2_temp) <- c("Applicant id", "Gender", "Technical skills", "Writing skills", "Leadership presence", "Speaking skills")

knitr::kable(hire2_temp, caption = "Phase-II information for the two applicants with a tie in phase III")
```

*Figure 2* shows the distribution of the total scores earned by candidates which is constructed from summing up the two *interview ratings*. From the plot, we see that most candidates with the highest scores are recruited. However, there are two candidates with a total score of 153, where only one of them is recruited who is a male. Hence, to explore further, we went back to the phase-II data and filter out these two observations.

### Conclusions

As *Table 4* shows, the male has higher scores in *technical skills*, while the female is better at categories like *writing skills*, *leadership presence*, and *speaking skills*. According to our phase-II model, *leadership presence* and *speaking skills* seems to have larger effect on the odds ratio than the other two determinants do. So, we would expect the female to be selected as a successful candidate instead of the male. 

In both Phase I and Phase II, we fit generalized linear models on different variables in each phase, and use likelihood ratio tests to find out whether gender plays an important role in passing rate. In phase I, we assess the impact of GPA, extracurricular activities and work experiences on passing status; for phase II, technical skills, writing skills, leadership presence and speaking skills are considered. Analyzing their odds ratios, these variables all have remarkable effects on whether candidates go to the next round smoothly. On the other hand, variable gender does not play a role here. The fitted models and the likelihood ratio tests tell us that gender does not have a noticeable impact on the final result, we tend to choose a simpler model that excludes the impact of gender here. Therefore, we do not think gender is a significant determinant of being a successful applicant in each hiring phase.

**TODO: phase-I: what do we expect from the tables and figures?**

## Is the amount of salary determined based only on the talents and performance of the employees?

### Data manipulation

We reformatted the values of *salary* in the original data set by taking off the "$" and "," and change the values from character values to numeric values for latter analysis. In addition to this, we re-level some factors for better display and ease of understanding. For instance, we re-level the factor of *seniority role* to reflect the ordering of the job title, from the least to the most senior.

### Exploratory plots/summary tables

```{r}
# salary distribution filled by gender
curr_1 <- curr_employee %>% 
  mutate(salary = str_replace(salary, "\\$", "")) %>% 
  mutate(salary = as.integer(str_replace(salary, ",", ""))) 

# re-level the factor
curr_1 <- curr_1 %>% 
  mutate(gender = fct_relevel(gender, "Prefer not to say", after = 0)) %>% 
  mutate(leadership_for_level = fct_relevel(leadership_for_level, "Needs improvement", after = 0)) %>% 
  mutate(role_seniority = fct_relevel(role_seniority, "Entry-level", after = 0)) %>% 
  mutate(role_seniority = fct_relevel(role_seniority, "Manager", after = 7)) %>% 
  mutate(role_seniority = fct_relevel(role_seniority, "Director", after = 7))

gender <- c("Prefer not to say", "Man", "Woman")
salary_mean <- c(46340, 48491, 45811)
prod_mean <- c(45.47, 48.99, 50.44)

sum_table <- data_frame(gender, prod_mean, salary_mean)
colnames(sum_table) <- c("Gender", "Mean productivity", "Mean salary")
knitr::kable(sum_table, caption = "Mean productivity and mean salary by gender")
```

*Table 7* shows the average *productivity* and *salary* by gender. From the table, we see that females possess the highest average productivity of 50.44, but the lowest average salary among the three genders. On the other hand, males have the second highest average productivity of 48.99 and the highest average salary. 

```{r, fig.cap="Salary vs. gender and leadership for level"}
options("scipen" = 10)
curr_1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = salary, fill = gender)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#fa8154", "#FFC300", "#51c6b9")) +
  labs(x = "Salary") +
  facet_wrap(~leadership_for_level) +
  coord_flip() +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Gender"))

# table(curr_1$gender, curr_1$leadership_for_level)
```

*Figure 6* displays the histogram of *salary* by *gender* and *leadership role*. Looking at the distribution of *salary* by *leadership role*, we see that the distribution is a bit right skewed, which is common as there are usually fewer employees with very high salaries than the ones with lower salaries. One thing worth notice is that the employees that *exceeds expectations* are all males, while the employees that *needs improvement* are all females. Despite this, employees that *exceeds expectations* seem to overall have slightly higher salaries than the employees that *needs improvement* do. 

### Method (Model)

```{r}
# model without gender
salary_mod_nog <- lmer(salary ~ productivity + leadership_for_level + role_seniority
                    + (1|employee_id), data = curr_1)
# build the final model
salary_mod <- lmer(salary ~ productivity + leadership_for_level + gender + role_seniority
                    + (1|employee_id), data = curr_1)

# lrtest(salary_mod_nog, salary_mod)
```

| 2 | 16  | -58671 | 2  | 114   | <2.2e-16   |


```{r}
# table for reporting
ests_s <- format(round(summary(salary_mod)$coef[, 1], 2), nsmall = 2)
salary_ci <- round(confint(salary_mod)[-c(1:2),], 2)
cis_s <- str_c("(", trimws(salary_ci[, 1]), ", ", salary_ci[, 2], ")")
salary_rownames <- c("Intercept", "Productivity", "Leadership: exceeds expectations", "Leadership: needs improvement", "Gender: man", "Gender: woman", "Junior I", "Junior II", "Senior I", "Senior II", "Senior III", "Manager", "Director", "Vice president")

salary_colnames <- c("Estimates", "95% CI")

salary_mod_table <- cbind(ests_s, cis_s)
rownames(salary_mod_table) <- salary_rownames
colnames(salary_mod_table) <- salary_colnames
knitr::kable(salary_mod_table, align = c("r", "r"), caption = "Model summary for salary")
```

Since we have repeated measurement in the data set of all the employees and a continuous response variable: *salary*, we consider fitting a linear mixed model, treating the *ids* for the employees as random effects. The fixed effects we consider fitting in the model are *productivity*, *leadership role*, *seniority role*, and *gender*, as we are interested whether the former three variables help quantify an employee's talents and abilities, while we want to figure out whether *gender* also plays a role in determining an employee's salary. Hence, the model we try to fit can be written out as follows: $$Y_{ij} = \boldsymbol X_{ij} \boldsymbol \beta + \epsilon$$. 

$Y_{ij}$: repeated measures j for salary on individual i, the response variable \
$\boldsymbol X$: model matrix for the fixed effects: *productivity*, *leadership role*, *seniority role*, and *gender* \
$\boldsymbol \beta$: the effect of covariates on the mean outcome \
$\epsilon$: residual errors 

To verify our assumptions for the usage of the model, firstly, we have a continuous response variable. Secondly, we identified *employee id* as our grouping variable resulting from the repeated measurement, so we include this grouping variable as our random effect. Lastly, even though the observations within each subject are not independent, the subjects themselves are independent. After building models that include *employee id* as only random intercept and random intercept and slope (interacting with *gender*), the likelihood ratio test tells us to adopt the model with only the random intercept (p = 0.9246). 

From *table 8*, we see that the grand average of the salary is 31900.93. Predictors that are significant are: *leadership role: exceeds expectations*, *leadership role: needs improvement*, and all levels of the *seniority role*, since the 95% confidence intervals for these coefficients do not include 0. Among these important covariates, both levels of the *leadership role* have large negative effects, while all levels of the *seniority role* have large positive effects on salary.

To determine whether *gender* plays a significant role in the determination of salary, we compare our current model with a nested model that have the same covariates as in our current model but without *gender*. The result of the model comparison using the likelihood ratio test is presented in table **TODO**. We see that the p-value appears to be really small (< 2.2e-16), so we expect having *gender* to improve our model by a significant amount. 


### Conclusions
